## Before starting

This protocol is used for preparing dual-indexed, Illumina-compatible gDNA libraries for whole genome sequencing. It doesn't rely on any commercial kits; rather, the protocol uses home-made master mixes for all reactions to minimize costs. Master mixes were retrieved from published sources and occasionally subject to minor changes (these will be indicated). References will be provided throughout to credit the original publications.

Briefly, this protocol uses an "on-bead"
